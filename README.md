# Streamlit+UCI+Kaggle
In this repository, I have used and analysed several datasets which are hosted on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
Furthermore, I have hosted them in a web form using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io).
