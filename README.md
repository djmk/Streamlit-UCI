# Streamlit + UCI Datasets + Kaggle
In this repository, I have analysed some datasets which are hosted on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).
Furthermore, I have hosted them in the web form using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io).
